PMG GRADUATE LEADERSHIP PROGRAM


csv-combiner.py contains the code to merge 2+ CSV files.

Merged CSVs will appear as "combined.csv" in the csv-combiner folder

Make sure to set the path variable to the correct file path before running the code

Add all CSV files to be merged into the fixtures folder

Thanks,
Kevin Shah
